	Include a PDF write up describing the algorithms you used to solve the three problems. Include the notebook PDF. This should not be more than 1 to 2 pages (excluding the PDF of the notebook code).

	After you're finished coding, please export this notebook to PDF.
	- Click the `[↑]` icon in the top right and click "PDF", then "Print to PDF".

	Include the **`project$project_num.pdf`** in your write-up:
